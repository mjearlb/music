10/19/21 - Milo Bauman & Andrew Mappes

Set 1: (22:42)
[1] On Magnolia (0:00 - 0:45) 
[2] On Magnolia (0:58 - 1:42) -> 
[3] Quesadilla Jam (1:42 - 2:39) -> 
[4] On Magnolia (2:39 - 3:45) -> 
[5] Quesadilla Jam 2 (3:45 - 13:24)
[6] On Magnolia (13:24 - 22:22)

NOTES: 
[1] Originally named quesadilla jam because Milo was cooking a quesadilla at the same time. Later, renamed to On Magnolia since it was On Magnolia. 

[5] Andrew teased Slave to the Traffic Light. 

[6] No whistled outro. 

REVIEWS: 
Milo: Pretty good night. This was a “practicing playing together jam because it’s been a long time” so we didn’t do a hi-fi recording. 
[5] Jam gets pretty heated thanks to Andrew's backing. Also pretty spacey in the cooldown. 
[6] Good transition. 
	(15:09): "All is quiet on Magnolia - Fuck!" 
		- Andrew Mappes
Overall great version. 

Andrew: Good for not jamming in awhile. Luke Jackson gave up a three run home run because he’s a god damn idiot. Go braves tho. Anyways, Am jams are good transition to Am was clean. Liked the F>G stuff I was doing. Transition to delay was rough. Need to find a better way to communicate when I wanna go slow. On Magnolia went well for never being played, pretty jams on D. No Whistling on On Magnolia ending. Cheers. Braves in 5 I guess :/
