Reviews: 
Milo: 
[2] The famed “Lamp Jam.” Not as good as we thought it was at the time. Nevertheless, it stands as a testament to how much we’ve improved. Has some nice moments
[8] Rough lmao. 
[11] Jack Straw is an old Firenze classic. Vocals not amazing, but fairly clean early version. That is to say, no stopping. Wrong chords galore, however. 
[12] To my knowledge, is the only Billy Breathes attempted. Went so badly that we never tried again. 
[13] Nice little Bird Song. 
[14] Mike’s Song riff not quite worked out, but passable. Transition to jam is rough, stops a couple of times. Jam starts at 59:45.
[15] UJB intro very pretty. Surprisingly, UJB might be the cleanest song of the whole set.
