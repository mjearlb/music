Reviews: 
Milo: Why tf is Althea so long lmao. Possum solo actually got some pretty interesting playing. First chorus Free gets a little torn, but comes back together. Free jam very quickly gets quiet. Minor-y and scary sounding. Spooky Firenze. Free jam is cool, but my bends are pretty out of tune. Return to chorus gets very noodley. Andrew likes strats position 2 (39:50).
