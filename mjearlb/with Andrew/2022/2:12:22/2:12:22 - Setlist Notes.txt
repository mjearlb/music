This was a free outdoor benefit concert in Bridgewater in Athens, GA. Half of the proceeds from this concert went towards the Jake Weitzel fund, “For the Weitzel’s of the world!”
Recording is incomplete, starts during intro to Shower Song. 
Soundcheck was in Andrew’s room with Andrew in chair, Milo on floor, and Jake Weitzel on bed. 
Set 1 took place outside in front of the house by the campfire. The crowd sat in lawn chairs. 

[1][2][3][4] No recording exists. 

[5] No recording exists. Debut. Mike’s Song tease at beginning to trick crowd we were launching into a Phish set, then went into this crowd pleaser. 

[6] Dog approached in the middle of song. Milo teased China Cat Sunflower afterwards.

[9] Milo sings. Jake hates Sample in a Jar, really wants Ya Mar. 

[10] Defeated, Andrew leaves to take another shot. 

Reviews: 
Milo: was a fun country roads, went okay. Harmonies were fun and everyone sang along as well. Andrew played guitar but I didn’t. Shower Song was alright, pretty fun. Sample went surprisingly well, First time me singing that by memory. Kyle was a fun bust out since we didn’t get to it last jam. 

Andrew: personally I think CR coulda gone better but it was nice to hear people sing. SS was short and sweet, but prob best for audience. Dog was cute. Very very cute, top tier dog. Sample was really good. First successful page/trey part for V2. Almost missed bridge but went okay

Kristina: we love a song that everyone can sing along to so good stuff, good stuff. It was a good show. Acoustic sound fit the vibe. 

Jess: nice. Im not done. nice. and wholesome. Turned to a little bit… phish, but still good. And thats it. 

Jake: sexually gratifying

Kyle: it was good. [Andrew: Anything else?] not really

Alexis: I liked it! I thought the dog interruption really added character.
