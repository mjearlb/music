Notes: 
Setlist was pre-planned

Traveling’  Light was planned, but skipped. 

Set one was electric. 

Set two was acoustic and played in Andrew’s room. Andrew sat in his desk chair and Milo sat on the floor. Much more laid back vibe than set one. 

[1] Andrew teased Fluffhead and Gotta Jibboo beforehand. Milo flubs vocals. Post-bridge is jammed out, isn’t half bad. Turns into really cool thing that Andrew made up around 7:30. Very cool sounding, may have been a song he learned. Great jam onwards. 

[2] 

[3]

[4] Debut. 

[5]

[6] Good Andrew solo

[7] Milo takes solo. Short and sweet. 

[8] Not terrible. Milo vocal flubs. Andrew takes first solo, Milo takes second. 

[9] Taken from after bridge. Dropped a verse. Andrew teased Character Zero afterwards. 


Reviews: 
Milo: Thought it was a great set! Great jamming and all around great playing. 
Pretty decent St. Stephen jam I thought. 
Best Free so far, but that’s not saying a whole lot. I didn’t feel great about the jam, but the composed parts were pretty clean. Need to work on singing at the same time as playing the guitar riff. 
Mike’s Song riffing in the beginning was pretty good I thought. Jam wasn’t all it could be, but was pretty alright. 
I Am Hydrogen was pretty bland, but we just need to get used to it. 
Wild Horses was best yet, vocally and instrumentally. 
The first half of my Deal solo was awesome I thought, but the second half I was unprepared for. I didn’t think it’d go on that long and I kinda used up all my ideas. So the first half is a pretty rippin’ little solo, but the second half can barely be considered noodling. 

Andrew: I'd give it a sexy eight out of ten. 

Kyle: Did you guys get lost in Ya Mar?
