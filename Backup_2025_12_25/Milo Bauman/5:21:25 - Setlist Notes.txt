[3] 2nd verse skipped, and it was redone. 

Reviews: 
Milo:
[5] My solo followed the chord changes really well I thought, but I think the tone was not great (amp was not loud enough). Andrew's solo is good, he takes it type 2. Type 2 part solo is good. 
[10] I think Andrew was doing a new harmony part. I liked it.
