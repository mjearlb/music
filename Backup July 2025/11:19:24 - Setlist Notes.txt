Reviews: 
Milo: 
Fun night! Longest set we've played in a while. Gizz was sweet. I noticed mid-way through the set that my amp was set to the "Crunch" channel instead of the "Clean" channel as it normally is. That explains my tone for my of this set. I remember during the last song at the Gizzard show that night, some shirtless guy came up to me (I was in aisle seat in balcony) and yelled "throw your shirt" and I said "what?" and he yelled "Take off your shirt and throw it!!" and motioned to heave it overhead into the floor seating below. 

[2] Solo was a bit long, but I thought it had some cool moments. 
[8] Pretty bad tbh. 
[10] Much better than the first one. Too fast though. Cool solo! 
[11] Type 2 jam. 
[14] Outro solo is pretty cool. 

Andrew: 
GIZZARD! We played for 1.5 hours which is pretty long. Tried out some new songs. Oh and Michael and jake were just too spun to continue at gizzard

[2] Mysteries went well. Solo was a little long but we were having fun lol. 
[8][10] Manifested gizzard to play that song we played during our jam.
