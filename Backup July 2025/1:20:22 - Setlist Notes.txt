Notes: 
Setlist was pre-planned. Traveling’ Light was planned to be played, but skipped. Set two was played acoustically and played in Andrew’s room. Andrew sat in his desk chair and Milo sat on the floor. Much more laid back vibe than Set 1. 

[1] Fluffhead and Gotta Jibboo were teased by Andrew beforehand. Milo flubs vocals. 
[4] Debut. 
[13] Debut. Yesterday was teased by Andrew beforehand. [12] was teased afterwards. 
[14] Bustout. Guitar outro only. 
[16] Mike's Song and Oh Well Pt. 1 were teased by Milo beforehand. Xanadu was teased by Andrew beforehand. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
Thought it was a great set! Great jamming and all around great playing. 

[1] Post-bridge is jammed out, isn’t half bad. Turns into really cool thing that Andrew made up around 7:30. Very cool sounding, may have been a song he learned. Great jam onwards. 
[2] Best Free so far, but that’s not saying a whole lot. I didn’t feel great about the jam, but the composed parts were pretty clean. Need to work on singing at the same time as playing the guitar riff.
[8] Pretty cool Andrew solo.  
[9] Pretty decent St. Stephen jam I thought. 
[3] Mike’s Song riffing in the beginning was pretty good I thought. Jam wasn’t all it could be, but was pretty alright. 
[4] I Am Hydrogen was pretty bland, but we just need to get used to it. 
[6] Wild Horses was best yet, vocally and instrumentally. Good Andrew solo. 
[7] The first half of my Deal solo was awesome I thought, but the second half I was unprepared for. I didn’t think it’d go on that long and I kinda used up all my ideas. So the first half is a pretty rippin’ little solo, but the second half can barely be considered noodling. Milo takes solo. Short and sweet. 
[8] Not terrible. Milo vocal flubs. Andrew takes first solo, Milo takes second. 
[9] Taken from after bridge. Dropped a verse. Andrew teased Character Zero afterwards. 
[12] Pretty. 

Andrew: 
I'd give it a sexy eight out of ten. 

[2] I think Free went really, really well. 

Kyle: 
Did you guys get lost in Ya Mar?
