Milo: 
Slave was awesome. Was the debut, but already really cool. I felt really good about my soloing on it. I remember that I didn't start recording because I saw Andrew take his phone out and place it between us (as I usually did to record us) and I assumed that he was recording it. Turns out, he was not.
