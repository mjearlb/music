Notes: 
Recording has a cut at the end of [7] Jam due to a phone call. 

[4] Originally noted as Expanding, Explaining. 
[7] Milo got a call at the end so recording is cut at 41:12. It is unknown how much time elapsed in the cut. McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters and Runaway Jim were teased by Milo afterwards. 
[9] False start. Contained “Micheal” chant intro (a la Wilson). Had a stop briefly for a phone call, but resumed in same place. 
[10] Debut. Tweezer was teased by Milo. 
[11] Rift was teased by Andrew afterwards. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
Really not a bad set overall. Nothing spectacular though. 

[1] Pretty good first guitar solo. 
[3] I think this was the one we made up beforehand where we just have a lot of interplay between the two guitars?
[2] Slave to the Traffic Light was not nearly as good as the one from 2021 that was unfortunately not recorded. 
[4] Expanding, Explaining was pretty good I thought. 
[7] Milo led jam. Sounded a bit like McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters. Could possibly be made into a song. Got a call at the end so recording is cut at end. 
[10] Needs practice.
