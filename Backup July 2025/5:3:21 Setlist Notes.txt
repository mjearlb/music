Notes: 
Set 1 was played electrically and set 2 was played acoustically. 

[1] Jam based off of Milo riff with Andrew playing leads. At 4:10, there is a change to Milo lead/Andrew rhythm. Pretty good I think. 7:40 Andrew changes rhythm style. Andrew declares Mr. Charlie around 9:20. Mr. Charlie really starts at 9:56, but I put it as 10:10 for some reason right after we recorded this, so Iâ€™m gonna leave it. 
[2] Good run of this
[3] Okay run
[5] Andrew Original #2
[7] Andrew's pedal board goofed up, no more electric for a bit
[8] slight vocal flub around 51:00, quits at 51:20ish
[9] I sing it poorly
[10] cool, good. Good soloing. Banter afterwards: chatting with Kristina about finals.
