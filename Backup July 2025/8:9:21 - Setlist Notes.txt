Notes: 
This was the first show played at Bridgewater. Set 1 recording is incomplete, an estimated 15+ minutes are missing. 

[2] Andrew teased and quoted Ghost. Andrew teased Miss You. Milo teased Can’t You Hear Me Knocking. 
[3] Type 2 Ghost. 
[4] Jake Mappes’ song Silver Bean. Andrew takes rhythm guitar, I take lead. Andrew sings some excerpts from the song, but it’s not exactly a cover, so I’m calling it a jam. Milo teased Can't You Hear me Knocking afterwards. Milo and Andrew teased Bird Song afterwards. 
[5] While discussing possible setlist options for Mapfest 2021. Fizzles out during the Landlady section. David Bowie, Casey Jones, Stairway to Heaven, and Sample in a Jar were teased by Milo afterwards. 
[6] Incomplete. 
[9] Incomplete. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
[1] A stellar jam, unfortunately I think the best parts were not recorded. Still some good jamming in here though. 
[2][3] Original note: really can be considered part of the first jam, however it’s a pretty abrupt change, so I’ve separated them. Starts building around 7:00. Around 7:53, I take rhythm with a riff and Andrew takes some leads with a harmonizer effect. Around 11:00, Andrew resumes backing, but then 11:40 we both riff for a bit. 
New note: Sick ass Ghost. Definitely worth checking out. Excellent -> Silver Bean as well. Tbh I didn't hear the Miss You or CYHMK teases, but they were present in the original notes, so I'll leave them. 
[4] Long lost original setlist now known thanks to Andrew. We played "this and this and this..."  However, as I recall we just jammed. 
[8] Pretty progression.
