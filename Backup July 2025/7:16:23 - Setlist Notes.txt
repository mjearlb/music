Reviews: 
Milo: 
My thoughts on the date: It couldn't be 7/18/24 because I had work that day. 7/16/24 is far more likely since that was before the N3 Phish Alpharetta show. I was definitely back in Blairsville by 7/18/23. 

[1] Starts off with some really pretty bad soloing from me, but improves by the end. Andrew's backing was good though.
