This was part of a run of shows billed as the “One year anniversary tour.” This was to mark the one year anniversary of the first recorded show (2/13/21), not the actual first show. First Magnolia Street show date unknown, but most likely around January 2020. First ever show was probably around January 2020.

[3] Possum solo feat Milo.

Reviews: 
Milo: 
[1] Why tf is Althea so long lmao. 
[3] Possum solo actually got some pretty interesting playing. 
[5] First chorus Free gets a little torn, but comes back together. Free jam very quickly gets quiet. Minor-y and scary sounding. Spooky Firenze. Free jam is cool, but my bends are pretty out of tune. Return to chorus gets very noodley. Andrew likes strats position 2 (39:50).
