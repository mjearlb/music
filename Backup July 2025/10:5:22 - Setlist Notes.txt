Milo: 
I remember Simon (main professor) said he liked that it referenced drugs. He thought I was leading everyone too much. The other professor (bald, I don't remember his name) thought it was very Zappa-esque. Someone came up to me afterwards and said they really liked my arpeggios. Got several compliments on my guitar playing after class, which I thought was funny since it wasn't really a hard song to play.
