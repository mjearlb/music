Milo: 
I remember that this was the first time I ever listened to Ween. I remember talking with him about Ween in the Magnolia St. kitchen with Andrew for a long time before we played. This show is honestly hard to listen to just because there's 3 guitars going. 

[1] Andrew takes the first solo, it's pretty good.
