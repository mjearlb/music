Reviews: 
Milo: 
[1] Actually pretty psychedelic. Some great backing from Andrew and just the right amount of distortion on my guitar. Sorta fell apart at the end when Andrew changed keys, but until that point I thought it was pretty cool. 
[2] Intro solo was not very good, my fault though. Solo ending went well. Weird ending. 

Kyle: 
It sounded good for a little bit. A bit darker than what you normally do, but I liked it.
