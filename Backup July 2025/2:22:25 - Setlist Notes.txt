Reviews: 
Milo: 
[4] I had some awesome playing in the intro. I should listen to this for ideas for the electric guitar part because I don't even remember it, but it's sweet. Cool solo part from 10:00ish to 10:35 also. Really stellar version overall. 
[5] It's got some cool bits, worth a listen. Cool solo part at 27:00 - 27:20. Andrew's got some great rhythm playing in this jam. 
[6] Amazing pull. Ending riff is incorrect, but still cool. Also, apparently we played this song 2 times total exactly 4 years apart??
[9] I think I remember feeling very good about this at the time. It was either this one or another 2025 Blaze On. But listening back, the solos were quite good, so probably this one. 
[12] Andrew's solo on this one is good. 
[15] Really cool intro. 
[16] Really not bad, solo included.
