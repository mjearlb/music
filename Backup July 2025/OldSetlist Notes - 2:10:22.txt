Notes

Reviews: 
Milo: 
not a half bad sample tbh. 
Deal was pretty fun, I think it had a pretty good jam as far as I remember
On my way was sick, I like this song a lot. Good jam to TL
Travelin light was a HEATER. Just really awesome jams. 
Mike’s stuff was really cool. Kinda ended up having two mike’s-like jams here. One before and one after mike’s song proper. 
Coming down was cool, and a good way to end the night. 
Overall: Good show, fun night

Andrew: Edible hit as we progressed. I am high. Hooray. On My Way went really well and travelin’ > mikes was lit. Coming down flubbed lyrics. Pretty creative stuff from me all together. Communication was good. Now we’re listening to Weekapaug Groove and it’s loud and good. Hope to go to Peach Fest and eat lots of tasty brownies. Cheers. 

WG from that show one after the shoreline show that Andrew listened to recently. Think it was the one that busted fee
Milo here! Wooooweeee what a WG jam man!
