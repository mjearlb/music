Reviews: 
Milo: 
Terrible show. We got way too high and couldn’t play shit lmao. I specifically remember looking out at the lake during Jack Straw and thinking wtf to myself. Especially funny since we thought we were on our "Island Tour" and were convinced beforehand that this would be our peak performance. 

[1] Andrew says around 3:00 that he’s too high to tune. Maybe that was a sign? Andrew gives up tuning at 5:00, orgasms at 5:12. 
[2] Warm Up Jam gets some heat going around 7:45. 
[4] 18:54 Andrew says “Let’s do Mike’s Song, I’m feeling really good about it”
[5] Interesting that we used to do Mike’s Song -> Fire on the Mountain so much. Did it on 3/28/21 as well. 
[6] 2nd FotM jam is weird af

Andrew: 
[3] "You know, the Grateful Dead always start with that song." (18:29)

Kristina: 
[3] "Good."
