Notes: 
Set 1 was a warm up/testing the new recording setup. No recording exists. GarageBand screw up :/ But was out first time recording line in from guitar effect pedals and having a room mic. Worked very well. 

Reviews: 
Andrew: 
Good expanding explaining for first real time going through. Saucy jam. 

Milo: 
Great jamming tonight. I especially like the jam into Sugar Magnolia and the Mike’s song. One of Andrew’s original songs was the last one played, Kyle said it was his favorite. Other songs were played, but no one remembers them.
