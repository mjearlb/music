This show was considered lost until 9/7/24 when it was found again and properly archived. Milo is playing the 1960s Harmony guitar from Dr. Schneider. An unknown audience is in attendance. 

[4] Has elements of Bird Song. 
[5] Jungle Love was teased by Milo afterwards. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
[2] Nasty tone on this. Love it. Good jam as well. I liked my rhythm playing in the first part of the jam better than my leads in the later parts. 
[3] Tone works less well for this song.
