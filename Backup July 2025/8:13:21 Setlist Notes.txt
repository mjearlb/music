Milo: 
Very jammy set, I felt great on the jams, but Andrew kept playing songs I didn’t know and that sorta took me out of it. Some good ones especially around beginning, but definite taper in quality for me near the end. Tbh I was getting a little miffed at the end bc he kept cutting me off when I was trying to build tension and whatnot.
