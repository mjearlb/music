Reviews: 
Milo: 
[1] Awesome CDT. Really good soloing imo. I actually played the solos in Em instead of E major like I normally do. Sounds interesting? Anyways, best CDT to date. Jam afterwards is pretty awesome as well. Original note: Milo takes leads. Guitar solo in intro, (2:48-4:53) (5:50(?)-8:40(?)) At 7:40ish Andrew thinks about taking it to Space, but Milo reels it back in for a return from the solo. Into Milo led riff jam at 8:46. Milo takes lead again at 10:12. 
[2] Bird Song was standard. 
[3] Ya Mar was not great, but after that CDT, it’s hard to complain. 
[4] Mike’s Song was fun. Again, not a standout version though. My tone was very good.  

Andrew: 
Milo came up with something on F#m when it first started but it's better for him to solo so I figured it out and started playing it so he could solo. Once again, pretty good on the communication side of music implies that we are both listening to each other. I don't know if Milo noticed, but our audience actually listened to this one and I think they liked it. Kinda changed the vibe since we were "performing" this one versus being background noise.. Idk, that may just be a me thought.
Overall: Good stuff minus Ya Mar. Hopefully we can get back into playing more than once or twice a week.

[1] CDT: Best one yet. Milo transitions into solos were very very smooth. Went spacey for a bit but we got back into CDT progression after holding on A and crescendoing back. We didn't say anything to each other but were on the same page which means we were listening which is a really good thing.
[2] Bird: Bird went well. Ended up flubbing lyrics for the second verse's first line. I thought my little lead work before the chorus was pretty good. Quality performance but for Bird Song that's pretty standard for us these days.
[3] Y(E)Mar: Felt pretty slow tbh. Lyrics are hard and we stopped being on the same page which was a bummer after CDT and Bird both going splendidly.

Kyle: 
Goofy version but the intro kinda hits ngl... Jam was neat.
