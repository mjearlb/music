Notes: 
Timestamps are relative to the GarageBand session. Set 2 was an acoustic set played for Kyle Fromme. 

[2] Milo provides backing, Andrew joins at 1:56. Becomes a major key jam at around 12:10. 
[3] Only the ending, sunshine daydream. Fire on the Mountain, Terrapin Station, China Cat Sunflower teased by Milo afterwards. 
[4] Last chorus done a capella. 
[5] It took about 8 tries before we could actually start it. Slow one, low energy. Solo got off rhythm. 
[6] Andrew leads the jam. Jam randomly goes between F#min and Bmaj. Recording cuts here on phone recording. Switching to GarageBand project, Andrew shouts “We’ll call you later!” And Milo says “damn it Kyle.” So, Kyle probably called. 
[7] Friend of the Devil, Case of You teased by Milo afterwards. Friend of the Devil teased by Milo afterwards. 
[8] 2 brief pauses in the middle to discuss song structure. 
[10] Milo solos on intro. Milo takes first lead, Andrew takes second. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
[2] Andrew's got some strong opinions about the lights. 
[4] Decent run. 
[5] Andrew lead on jam afterward is pretty good. 
[6] Great transition actually. I am still doing hammer ons in the riff because I didn’t realize that it was all picked. 
[10] Really pretty good!
