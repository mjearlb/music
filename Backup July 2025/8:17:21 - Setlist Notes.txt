New archival release. Recording discovered 8/6/22, to be released on the one year anniversary. All proceeds to benefit the Bauman/Mappes/Fromme Beer Fund for the People. Features the first known recording of the song “Expanding & Explaining.”

[1] Interesting, though not very cohesive. 
[2] Milo takes first solo, Andrew takes second. 
[3] Milo messes with sliding around and Andrew starts playing Mountains in the Mist. 
[4] Turns into a Jam kind of. 
[5] Jam based on a Milo riff which is kinda Gotta Jibboo-esque. Definitely turns Mike’s Song-y around 24:00. Expanding & Explaining was teased by Andrew afterwards. 
[6] Debut, instrumental, incomplete. 
[7] Incomplete. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
Crowd noise makes this one a little harder to hear at times, but adds to the atmosphere. 
[1] Beginning jam is very good. Starts a little shaky, but then we found our groove. 
[2] Deal was fairly standard. 
[4] MitM Jam was neat. 
[5] MR Jam was cool also. 
[6] pretty rough lol. (But cool!)
[7] Hard to hear the vocals. 
[8] ‘nuff said
