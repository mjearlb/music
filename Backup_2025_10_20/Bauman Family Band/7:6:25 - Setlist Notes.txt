We played at church this day. During the first service, when we first got up there, apparently we were supposed to start with I'll Fly Away. No one told me. As everyone was just standing around, I thought they were waiting on me to start Where the Soul. After the first performance, everyone but dad went home to pack for MI. When we got back to church, I worked out a better intro for Where the Soul. After the second performance, dad and I stayed behind to pack everything up. The girls went home for Beulah and left for MI. Dad and I left in mom's Lexus after cleaning up around 12:20pm.
