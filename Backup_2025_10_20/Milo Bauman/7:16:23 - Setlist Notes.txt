Set 1: (11:24)
[1] Shower Song (0:11 - 7:47)

Notes: 
The date for this show is unconfirmed. Metadata indicates the show took place on 7/18/23 at 4:04pm, but this is unlikely. 

[1] Over the Hills and Far Away was teased by Andrew beforehand. Mike's Song was teased by Milo.
[2] I Am Hydrogen and The Curtain With were teased by Milo beforehand. Rift was teased by Andrew afterwards. Andrew left before the beginning of this song. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
My thoughts on the date: It couldn't be 7/18/24 because I had work that day. 7/16/24 is far more likely since that was before the N3 Phish Alpharetta show. I was definitely back in Blairsville by 7/18/23. 

[1] Starts off with some really pretty bad soloing from me, but improves by the end. Andrew's backing was good though.
