12/14/22 - Exchange Band (Milo Bauman, Helene Harm, Jon Stagg, Gemma, Laura Chu, & Harry Armitage)

Venue: 
University of Liverpool
School of Music Music Hub
Liverpool, England, UK

Set 1: 

Notes: 
We didn't actually play anything, we showed up for our final exam results. We did very well, probably mostly because we were only there for 1 semester. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
I remember Simon saying how impressed he was with how I made his Telecaster sound. I said I liked it and it was a pretty good guitar and he said something like "I had written that off as sort of a junk guitar." Then the other professor said something like "Well maybe that's why you never got any good sounds out of it." They clearly had some undisclosed beef.
