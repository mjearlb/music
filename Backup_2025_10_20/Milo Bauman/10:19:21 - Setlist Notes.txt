Notes: 
[1] Originally noted as Quesadilla Jam because Milo was cooking a quesadilla at the same time. Later, changed to On Magnolia since it was actually On Magnolia. 
[5] Andrew teased Slave to the Traffic Light. 
[6] No whistled outro. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
Pretty good night. This was a “practicing playing together jam because it’s been a long time” so we didn’t do a hi-fi recording. 
[5] Jam gets pretty heated thanks to Andrew's backing. Also pretty spacey in the cooldown. 
[6] Good transition. 
	(15:09): "All is quiet on Magnolia - Fuck!" 
		- Andrew Mappes
Overall great version. 

Andrew: 
Good for not jamming in awhile. Luke Jackson gave up a three run home run because he’s a god damn idiot. Go braves tho. Anyways, Am jams are good transition to Am was clean. Liked the F>G stuff I was doing. Transition to delay was rough. Need to find a better way to communicate when I wanna go slow. On Magnolia went well for never being played, pretty jams on D. No Whistling on On Magnolia ending. Cheers. Braves in 5 I guess :/
