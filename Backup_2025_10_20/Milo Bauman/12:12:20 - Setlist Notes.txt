This show featured Jake Weitzel on bass. For parts of the show, Milo and Jake switched instruments. No recording exists. It is not known if this is the exact date of the performance. 

Reviews:
Milo: I don't remember this very well. Pretty sure there were 2 sets though. I'm just guessing with the songs played since we probably kept them simple for Jake since he didn't play bass. 

I remember at one point we were all 3 playing guitar and I thought, "This is too much guitar" and I grabbed Jake Mappes' bass and played it on a few songs. Then for Set 2, Jake took bass. I think he played my black Stratocaster (the cheap one). I'm pretty sure I tried to get him to play my nice Strat once I switched to bass, idk if he ended up switching though.
