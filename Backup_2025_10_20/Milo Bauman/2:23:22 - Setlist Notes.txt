Reviews: 
Milo: 
[4] Best (recorded) slave so far. I was so sweaty by the end of it though lol. Had to stop playing to take off my jean jacket. 

Andrew:
[4] Went well. I could work on tuning my low notes a bit better but who's counting. Lead work was pretty and synchronized well with vocals and chords... most notably the last "On Magnolia" to the slow section to end the song.
[5] Very pretty slave. Some work needed on Em D and C section before big jam. Could really use a Page McConnell lol
[6] Sleeper of the night. This song was straight bussin'. I wonder if we could get some harmonious harmonies on the chorus
[7] Gumbo was good. Pretty standard. Transition to Shower Song seemed a little forced but it 'twas a good Gumbo. Lead for me went okay, got something cooking look good!
[8] Good jams, if we do add a quick little instrumental section between verses (which would be great and would break up the verses) it would need to be <25 seconds or so. Went type two. When I was playing Db7 Milo was playing some other key and it felt crunchy and eerie and it was awesome. I was thinking about what song we could do from here and Arcadia (since it also starts Db7) would've been perfect but we haven't worked on that one enough.
[9] Segue to Mr. Charlie was a little rough but I somehow remembered all the vocals which is no small feat haha. Good way to end a good night
