2/14/22 - Milo Bauman & Andrew Mappes

Venue: 
Bridgewater
260 Katydid Drive
Athens, GA

Set 1: (15:18)
[1] Digital Delay Loop Jam (0:20 - 1:12)
[2] Slave to the Traffic Light (1:36 - 2:35)
[3] Althea (2:48 - 12:20)
[4] Digital Delay Loop Jam (12:22 - 15:18)

Notes: 
This was part of a run of shows billed as the “One year anniversary tour.” This was to mark the one year anniversary of the first recorded show, not the actual first show. First Magnolia Street show date unknown, but most likely around August 2, 2020. First ever show was probably around January 2020. Incidentally, the timestamp of this recording is 4:20pm. 

[1] Althea was teased by Milo beforehand. Andrew starts space. 
[4] Milo initially leads DDLJ. However, Andrew creates a spacey atmosphere. 

Reviews: 
Milo: Must have to be really really zooted to understand the 1st 3 minutes. 
[3] Althea is actually pretty clean though. Andrew's use of the wah on Althea is cool. 
[4] DDLJ is pretty cool. Feels weird that the recording ends with the Jam fading out and no voices.
