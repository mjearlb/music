Reviews: 
Milo: 
[3] Last 2 AC/DC Bags have had bluegrass jams. 
[4] Cool solos. Andrew starts his looper and joins the solo. 
[8] Surprisingly good. I thought the jam was fun. 
[14] Pretty interesting solo. 
[15] Sick ass jam. 
[16] I actually managed to work out some cool harmony parts imo. 
[17] Andrew's rhythm parts during the Em were very cool. 
[18] Really good jam. 

Andrew: 
In other news, I listened to the first 33 minutes of jam 2 from last Thursday. 
EJam>Jack Straw
Gumbo>On My Way
A few notes->
[4] Got a little sloppy near the last verse, but the jam was sweet. ("Hot!")
[8] Sick. 
[9] Sick. 
[10] E jam was neat. I started soloing and when I finished Milo did some piano playin. I joined the piano for about 2 seconds but went into jack straw
[11] Jack straw was definitely not our best but definitely not our worst. 
[12] Gumbo was a great call. Probably my best solo on gumbo at least in recent memory. 2nd verse was omitted but oh well. Milo solo went slightly type 2 into a Ebm7 and some major chord. Got to this point where the wah pedal was doing a ton of the work. SUPER hot gumbo. 
[13] OMW was also sweet. I played the wrong chord to start but we got it. The jam went nuts. Really really cool stuff I. The loop jam was fuckin sick and we ended the jam together too which was awesome
