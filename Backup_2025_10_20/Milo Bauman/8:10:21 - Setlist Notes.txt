Note: 
Phone Recording has a click. That is permanent. If laptop recording does, it can be removed through GarageBand original file. For some reason GB feels the need to export audio files with the stupid click track included in the mix. 

Reviews: 
Milo: 
Great night of great jamming! Geulah Papyrus (2) Jam and Jam before CDT were my favorites. Especially the pre-CDT one. I think I played great this night, with some honestly pretty cool solos. 
From Phone recording notes: Awesome jam at around 1:46:00. I really like the riff I made up for it. It goes into CDT. Song before that was pretty great Geulah Papyrus jam, which then goes into free which flopped. 

Andrew:
